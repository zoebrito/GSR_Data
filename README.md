# GSR Data Analysis for Trigeminal Neuralgia

This project focuses on analyzing Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data to explore the correlation between pain intensity and GSR levels in individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia.

## Overview

Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain condition affecting the trigeminal nerve, causing intense facial pain. Understanding the physiological responses associated with pain perception, such as GSR levels, can provide valuable insights into the condition and potential treatment approaches.

## Data Collection

- GSR data was collected using sensors placed on participants' skin during pain episodes.

## Analysis Approach

- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between pain intensity ratings and GSR levels using statistical methods.
- **Area Under Curve (AUC)**: Calculate the AUC for GSR data to quantify overall skin conductance response during pain episodes.
